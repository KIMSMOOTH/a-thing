  <h2>PASTA란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasta" target="_blank" title="Pasta on Wikipedia">Pasta</a>
    is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour
    mixed with water or eggs, and formed into <strong><u>sheets or other shapes</u></strong>,
    then cooked by boiling or baking.Pastas are divided into two broad categories:
    dried (pasta secca) and fresh (pasta fresca).
  </p>
  <p>
    Most dried pasta is produced
    commercially via an extrusion process, although it can be produced at home.
    Fresh pasta is traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple
    machines. Fresh pastas available in grocery stores are produced commercially
    by large-scale machines.
